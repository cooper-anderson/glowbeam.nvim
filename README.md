# Glowbeam the colorscheme ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰

## About

This is my personal colorscheme that I have been working on for a while and
always wanted to make it openly available, so here it is! A lot of the colors
are inspired from some previous colorschemes I used many years ago like
[`sjl/badwolf`](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf) and
[`josuegaleas/jay`](https://github.com/josuegaleas/jay), as well as some
JetBrains applications' colorschemes.

This colorscheme used to be created entirely manually, but then a while ago I
switched to using [`Iron-E/nvim-highlite`](https://github.com/Iron-E/nvim-highlite).
Now, we have migrated to the amazing [`rktjmp/lush.nvim`](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim)
(such an amazing plugin by the way, thank you @rktjmp and community!)

## Installation

You probably know how this works by now, but here is an example anyway:

- packer.nvim
```lua
use "cooper-anderson/glowbeam.nvim"
```

- vim-plug
```vim
Plug "cooper-anderson/glowbeam.nvim"
```

## Notes

- Because of the recent switch to Lush, I removed a bunch of specifically
tailored colors for some filetypes, but those should be added back in time
- So far I have only tested this colorscheme with `termguicolors` enabled
